"""AGENTIC STAR Marketplace entry point — the container's ``CMD``.

Entry adapter only, in the same sense ``src/api/server.py`` is one. The runner owns the
lifecycle: it constructs the graph class, compiles it, builds the SecretProvider, provisions
secrets, then runs one Marketplace execution (identity, input, progress events, terminal
delivery, exit) and exits.

The runner constructs the graph itself, so ``config/config.yaml`` is loaded here and handed
over explicitly — without it every runtime parameter would fall back to its framework default
on this path only. The file is read the same way ``src/api/server.py`` reads it, so both entry
paths resolve identical values.

``agent_name`` / ``namespace`` mirror the values ``src/api/server.py`` passes to
``secrets_factory``, so secrets resolve from one place whichever transport started the agent.
